{% docs __overview__ %}
These data models aim to systematically increase the granularity of drug violation arrests observed in the CPD Data Infrastructure (CPD Infra). Presently, this fulfills a data request from the Above and Beyond Family Recovery Center: identify historical opioid possession arrests in Chicago at the citywide and community area levels (East and West Garfield Park).
